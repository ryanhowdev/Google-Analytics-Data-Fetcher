Adjusting error handling for a production environment involves ensuring that the application can gracefully handle unexpected issues without compromising security or user experience. Here's how to improve error handling in the Python application for fetching and storing Google Analytics data:

### 1. Centralized Error Handling

Implement a centralized error handling mechanism that can catch and process exceptions in a uniform way. This could involve creating a custom exception handler that logs errors, sends notifications to administrators, and provides user-friendly error messages.

```python
import logging

def handle_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback):
    if issubclass(exc_type, KeyboardInterrupt):
        sys.__excepthook__(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)
        return

    logging.error("Uncaught exception", exc_info=(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback))

sys.excepthook = handle_exception
```

### 2. Detailed Logging

Implement detailed logging, especially for database operations and API calls. Log enough information to diagnose issues, but be careful not to log sensitive information such as passwords or personal data.

- Use Python's built-in `logging` module to log errors and other important system information.
- Configure different log levels (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG) appropriately.
- Store logs in a secure and scalable storage solution.

### 3. Graceful Degradation

Design your application to degrade gracefully in case of an error. For example, if the database is temporarily unavailable, the application could still show data from a cache and notify the user of the issue without completely failing.

### 4. User Feedback

Provide clear, non-technical error messages to the user. Avoid exposing stack traces or database error messages which could be used for malicious purposes.

```python
try:
    # risky operation
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    # display a generic error message to the user
    print("Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again later.")
```

### 5. Security Considerations

- **Error Disclosure:** Avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages. Attackers can use detailed error information to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.
- **Monitor and Alert:** Set up monitoring and alerting for errors so that you are quickly informed about issues in production. This allows for rapid response and resolution of critical issues.

### 6. Retry Mechanisms

For transient errors, especially those related to network issues or temporary service unavailability, implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

```python
import time

def with_retries(method, max_attempts=3):
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            return method()
        except TemporaryError as e:
            wait = 2 ** attempt
            logging.warning(f"Operation failed. Retrying in {wait}s.")
            time.sleep(wait)
    raise Exception("Maximum retry attempts reached.")
```

### 7. Dependency and Third-party Service Failures

Handle failures from dependencies and third-party services gracefully. This includes checking for API rate limits, handling timeouts, and considering circuit breakers for services that are critical but should not bring down your application if they fail.

### 8. Regular Testing

Regularly test your error handling paths. This can be done through unit tests, integration tests, and manual testing to ensure that errors are handled as expected across different parts of the application.

Improving error handling for a production environment involves a combination of technical safeguards, good practices, and continuous monitoring. By implementing these strategies, you can ensure that your application remains reliable, secure, and user-friendly under various conditions.
